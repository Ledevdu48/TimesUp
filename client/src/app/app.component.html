        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Times Up Online, the live game where you and your friends try to guess your custom proposals during various stages!</p>
        <h2>To Start</h2>
        <p>
            Enter a pseudo and a room code which you will share with your friend to play.
        </p>
        <h2>To Play</h2>
        <p>
            Once you have set up the parameters of the game and the teams, you will be asked to create your proposals for the rest of the game. <br>
            In the first step, you can use any word (except the ones in the proposal) to make your team guess the proposal. <br>
            In the second step, you must use only one word. <br>
            In the third step, you will have to draw something to make your team guess the proposal (no words written). 
        </p>
        <h2>Chat</h2>
        <p>You must use another program (like Discord) to chat with your friends during the game.</p>
